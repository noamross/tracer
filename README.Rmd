A package to collect trace information from optimization functions. Very
early-stage and experimental.

Use `nloptr_tr()` in place of `nloptr::nloptr()`.  It will give the same
results but append the trace information to the result as an attribute, as well
as adding the class `traced`.

Use `tracer(result)` to retrieve the trace information.

## TODO:

 - General package infrastructure, documentation, testing, etc.
 - Methods for other optimizers (**minqa**, **optim**, **optimx**)
